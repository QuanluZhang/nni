Super-module Lib
================

Super-module expresses a family of modules. It could be a `Cell` in XXX, `AutoDropout` in XXX. It can be used just like a normal module in PyTorch or TensorFlow, as a building block of a DNN model. Super-module is very useful when developers are not sure which concrete module structure performs better. There are two types APIs for express a model/search space: building primitives and super-modules.
